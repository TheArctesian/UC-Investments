## Executive Summary

The University of California system has made significant strides in reducing its fossil fuel investments over the past five years, with direct holdings dropping from $13.4 billion to $8.2 billion as of Q4 2023. However, indirect exposure through index funds and private equity remains substantial, presenting ongoing challenges for complete divestment.

## Background

Following sustained pressure from student activists and faculty groups, the UC Regents announced in 2019 their intention to divest from fossil fuel companies. This commitment aligned with the university's broader carbon neutrality goals and recognition of climate-related financial risks.

## Key Findings

### Direct Holdings Reduction

Our analysis of SEC filings and portfolio disclosures reveals:

- **38% reduction** in direct fossil fuel holdings since 2019
- Complete divestment from coal companies achieved in 2021
- Remaining exposure primarily in natural gas utilities and pipeline operators

### Index Fund Challenge

The UC's $35 billion allocation to index funds presents a structural challenge:

1. **MSCI World Index**: Contains approximately 4.8% fossil fuel exposure
2. **S&P 500 Index**: Includes 5.2% energy sector allocation
3. **Custom ESG indices**: Limited availability and higher management fees

### Private Equity Complexity

Private equity investments totaling $12 billion lack transparency:

- Limited disclosure requirements for GP holdings
- Long lock-up periods preventing immediate divestment
- Secondary market sales would incur significant discounts

## Comparative Analysis

When compared to peer institutions:

| Institution | Direct FF Holdings | Total Divestment Target |
|------------|-------------------|------------------------|
| UC System | 8.2% | 2030 |
| Harvard | 6.5% | 2050 |
| Yale | 7.1% | No commitment |
| Stanford | 5.9% | 2029 |

## Recommendations

### Short-term Actions

1. **Increase transparency** in private equity holdings through enhanced reporting
2. **Develop custom indices** excluding fossil fuel companies
3. **Engage portfolio companies** on transition planning

### Long-term Strategy

The UC should consider:

- Establishing a dedicated sustainable investment team
- Creating incentive structures aligned with divestment goals
- Developing in-house capabilities for direct investment management

## Impact Assessment

### Financial Performance

Preliminary analysis suggests minimal performance impact:

- Divested portfolio: +11.2% annualized (2019-2023)
- Benchmark with fossil fuels: +10.8% annualized
- Volatility remained comparable

### Carbon Footprint

Estimated emissions reduction:
- Scope 3 emissions reduced by 28% through divestment actions
- Avoided emissions: 2.3 million tons CO2e annually

## Challenges Ahead

Several obstacles remain:

1. **Legal constraints**: Fiduciary duty considerations
2. **Practical limitations**: Index fund architecture
3. **Political pressure**: Stakeholder disagreements
4. **Measurement difficulties**: Scope 3 emissions tracking

## Conclusion

While the UC system has made meaningful progress on fossil fuel divestment, achieving complete divestment by 2030 will require innovative approaches to index fund management and private equity exposure. The experience provides valuable lessons for other institutional investors navigating similar transitions.
