This is currently an incredibly disorganized and poorly made repository. There's alot of files that were used intermittently throughout stages of research and data formatting, which makes navigating this all rather confusing. I'm hoping to clean all of this up in the coming days, which should allow for people to more easily contribute. Additionally, all of the data collection happens manually at the moment, but over this summer I'm aiming to make it 100% automated, so as soon as the UC releases new investment reports, this site updates. 

The big task that people can contribute to for the time being is getting data on the composition of funds that we're invested in. You can view that on the website, or in /final-datasets/listed_investments.csv. We've analyzed all public equity funds with over 100 million invested, but we'd like to eventually have analyzed everything. Going through these unanalyzed investments, hunting down their composition, and entering all found data in the format shown in /Data-Collection/csv-files/ would be immensely helpful, but I'm also hoping to rewrite this datastructure ASAP, as it is very inconvenient and just dumb.

Although contribution is difficult at the moment due to all the flaws discussed above, if you do end up doing some work on this, please open a pull request! 

Thank you <3
